Welcome to **Catch It Green!**, a fast-paced mini-game where you collect eco-friendly products while dodging high-carbon footprint ones.  
Get ready to move your cart, sharpen your reflexes, and help the environment!

## 🕹️ How to Play

**Catch It Green!**

- **Take a look at the shopping list first!**  
- Use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to move the cart (swipe on mobile)
- **Catch as many low carbon footprint items** as you can to gain positive points!
- **Avoid high carbon footprint items** that will lower your score!

## 🌿 Special Challenge

If you collect all five items shown at the top of the screen, the supermarket will buy a tokenized carbon credit thanks to your eco-friendly shopping!

Can you complete the shopping list and become an eco-hero? 🌎🛒

## 🕵️‍♂️ Can you unlock the Mysterious Character?

Only the most sustainable shoppers — those scoring 330 points or more — will catch a glimpse of a secret pixel-art figure hidden deep in the game.
Think you’ve seen him? You have to do better than better! 👀🌱
